# Scrape-OSRS-Player-Counts

**Context**<br>
I wanted to build upon my web scraping experience from a group project for school (CMPT 353) while obtaining time series data that can be analyzed and used to create dashboards.
<br><br>


**Results** <br>
Created an ETL pipeline / web scraper to scrape and store player counts from [Old School RuneScape's world select](https://oldschool.runescape.com/slu) into a MySQL database using Python, a Raspberry Pi and cron.
<br><br>
